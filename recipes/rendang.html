    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Rendang is a rich and aromatic beef dish originating from the Minangkabau people of West Sumatra, Indonesia. Often referred to as one of the worldâ€™s most flavorful stews, 
        it is made by slow-cooking beef in a fragrant mixture of coconut milk, lemongrass, galangal, garlic, ginger, chilies, and a variety of spices. 
        Over several hours, the liquid reduces, and the beef absorbs the spices while becoming tender and caramelized, giving rendang its signature dark, almost dry consistency and depth of flavor.</p>
        <p>Traditionally, rendang is more than just a meal, it carries cultural significance and is often served during festive occasions, ceremonies, or to honor guests. 
            Its long cooking process symbolizes patience, resilience, and togetherness, making it a dish deeply tied to heritage. 
            Today, rendang is enjoyed across Indonesia and beyond, celebrated for its balance of heat, richness, and spice that lingers long after the last bite.</p>

                <li>1 kg beef </li>
                <li>2500 ml thick coconut milk from 3 coconuts</li>

        <li>After 15 minutes, turn on the stove. The beef will begin to release its juices. Stir occasionally as the liquid increases.</li>
        <li>Continue cooking until the liquid reduces.</li>
        <li>Once the liquid has reduced, pour in the coconut milk. Lower the heat and cook, stirring continuously, until the beef becomes tender and the coconut milk has thickened and reduced.</li>
