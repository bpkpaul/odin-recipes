 <h3>Description</h3>
 <p>Ayam geprek is a beloved Indonesian street food that quite literally means “smashed chicken.” 
    The dish typically starts with crispy fried chicken, often coated in flour, which is then pressed or smashed together with freshly ground sambal. 
    This preparation not only infuses the chicken with fiery chili flavor but also softens its texture, making every bite both crunchy and tender at once. 
    Its name reflects the straightforward, rustic method of serving: a humble yet satisfying comfort food that has become popular across Indonesia.</p>
    <p>What sets ayam geprek apart is its unapologetic spiciness. 
        The sambal is usually made with generous amounts of bird’s eye chilies, creating a bold heat that lingers and can be adjusted from mildly hot to extremely fiery, depending on preference. 
        For many Indonesians, the pleasure lies in the challenge of enjoying the intense spice, often accompanied by a mound of steamed rice and sometimes extra side dishes like fried tempeh or tofu. 
        Ayam geprek has grown from a simple street stall creation into a nationwide favorite, celebrated for its balance of crunch, heat, and simplicity.</p>
        <h3>Ingerdients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 pieces chicken thigh fillet</li>
            <li>Seasoned all-purpose flour, as needed for coating</li>
            <li>1/2 packet instant marinade seasoning</li>
            <li>1 egg optional, can be skipped</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic</li>
            <li>5 red bird’s eye chilies</li>
            <li>7 green bird’s eye chilies</li>
            <li>Salt, mushroom stock powder, and sugar, to taste</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Prepare the chicken thigh fillets and clean them thoroughly. Add the marinade seasoning and garlic powder, then mix well.</li>
            <li>Add the seasoned all-purpose flour and mix again. Store in the refrigerator overnight to allow the flavors to absorb, or let it rest for 1–2 hours if short on time.</li>
            <li>Prepare more seasoned all-purpose flour for coating. Dredge the chicken so it is evenly covered in flour. Do not press too hard to avoid clumping.</li>
            <li>Heat oil over medium-low heat. Fry the chicken slowly on low heat so it cooks through evenly and stays juicy. Flip occasionally to ensure even cooking.</li>
            <li>To make the sambal: bring water to a boil and blanch the chilies and garlic until softened. 
                Mash them coarsely in a mortar, then add salt. Heat a little oil in a pan, sauté briefly, and add sugar. Adjust seasoning to taste.</li>
            <li>Once the chicken is cooked, smash it (geprek) and add the sambal on top. Alternatively, place the sambal first and smash the chicken into it.</li>
            <li>Serve hot with steamed rice and fresh vegetables (lalapan).</li>
        </ol>
